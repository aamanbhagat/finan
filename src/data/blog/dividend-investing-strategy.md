## What Are Dividends?

### Definition
A dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders, usually in the form of cash or additional shares. Companies distribute profits to reward investors for their ownership stake.

### Who Pays Dividends?
- Mature, profitable companies
- Typically established businesses with steady cash flow
- Often larger cap stocks in stable industries
- Not usually growth stocks

### Types of Dividends

**1. Cash Dividends** (Most Common)
- Paid in cash to shareholder accounts
- Quarterly, semi-annual, or annual
- Subject to dividend taxes

**2. Stock Dividends**
- Payment in additional company shares
- No immediate cash received
- Dilutes share count
- Tax-deferred

**3. Special Dividends**
- One-time extra payments
- Often from unusual profits
- Not recurring

## Why Dividend Investing?

### Key Benefits

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **Passive Income** | Regular cash payments without selling shares |
| **Compounding** | Reinvest dividends to buy more shares |
| **Tax Efficiency** | Qualified dividends taxed at lower rates |
| **Stability** | Dividend stocks often less volatile |
| **Inflation Protection** | Companies raise dividends over time |
| **Retirement Income** | Steady cash flow in retirement |

## Dividend Metrics Explained

### Dividend Yield
**Formula**: Annual Dividend ÷ Stock Price

**Example**: Stock trading at $100 with $4 annual dividend = 4% yield

**Target**: 2-6% for sustainable dividends

### Dividend Growth
**Definition**: Year-over-year increase in dividend payments

**Example**: Company raises dividend from $2.00 to $2.10 = 5% growth

**Ideal**: 5-10% annual growth

### Payout Ratio
**Formula**: Annual Dividend ÷ Net Income

**Example**: Company earns $10 billion, pays $3 billion in dividends = 30% payout

**Interpretation**: 
- Below 60% = Sustainable and safe
- 60-80% = Reasonable with growth potential
- Above 80% = Risk of dividend cut

### Dividend Coverage Ratio
**Formula**: Free Cash Flow ÷ Total Dividends Paid

**Example**: $5 billion free cash flow ÷ $2 billion dividends = 2.5x coverage

**Interpretation**: Higher ratios = safer dividends

## Building a Dividend Portfolio

### Step 1: Assess Your Goals

### Step 3: Select Quality Stocks

**Dividend Stock Screening Criteria**:

- Stable or growing free cash flow
- Competitive market position
- Reasonable valuation

### Step 4: Diversify Your Portfolio

| **Dividend ETFs** | 25% | VYM, SCHD, SDY |
| **Emerging Dividend Stocks** | 15% | Growth potential |

### Step 5: Reinvest or Use Income?

**Reinvestment Strategy** (Compounding)

- Accelerates wealth building
- No need for external income
- Years 1-20: Focus on compounding

**Income Strategy** (Spending)
- Use dividends for living expenses

- Requires larger portfolio

## Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)

### What is DRIP?
Automatically reinvests dividends to buy more shares without commissions.

### Benefits
- Compound growth through share accumulation
- No trading costs or taxes until selling
- Emotional discipline (autopilot)
- Increased dividend income each period

### Example: DRIP Power

**Starting Investment**: $10,000 in stock yielding 4%
**Time Period**: 30 years
**No Reinvestment**: $12,000 in dividends (4% × 30 years)
**With DRIP**: $32,434 (assuming 3% stock appreciation)

**Total Difference**: $20,434 extra from compounding!

## Dividend Tax Considerations

### Tax Rates on Dividends

**Qualified Dividends** (Preferential Tax Rate)
- Long-term holdings (60+ days)
- Tax rates: 0%, 15%, or 20%
- Most dividend stocks qualify
- Much lower than ordinary income tax

**Non-Qualified Dividends**
- Short-term holdings
- Taxed as ordinary income (10-37%)
- Should be avoided

### Tax-Efficient Strategies

1. **Hold Dividend Stocks Long-Term**
   - Qualify for lower tax rates
   - 60+ days before ex-dividend date

2. **Use Tax-Advantaged Accounts**
   - Hold dividend stocks in 401(k), IRA
   - Defer or eliminate dividend taxes
   - Best for high-yield stocks

3. **Harvest Tax Losses**
   - Sell losing positions
   - Offset capital gains
   - Maintain portfolio allocation

4. **Donate Appreciated Stock**
   - Avoid capital gains tax
   - Receive charitable deduction
   - Help causes you care about
