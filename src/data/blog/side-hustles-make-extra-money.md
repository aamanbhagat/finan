## Tax Considerations for Side Hustles

### Income Reporting

**Self-Employment Income Threshold:**
- If earning $400+/year from side work, file Schedule C (self-employment)
- Keep detailed records of all income
- Report all income even if under threshold

### Deductible Expenses

**Home Office:** $5/day or actual expenses (utilities, rent %)

**Equipment:** Laptop, software, office furniture (depreciate over time)

**Supplies:** Pens, paper, printer ink, internet (percentage used for business)

**Professional Services:** Accounting, legal fees (deductible)

**Mileage:** 67 cents/mile (2025 rate) for business mileage

**Other Costs:** Hosting, subscriptions, education, marketing

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts

**Solo 401(k):** Can contribute up to $69,000/year (2024) to retirement tax-free

**SEP-IRA:** Contributes up to 25% of net self-employment income

**Solo Roth 401(k):** Tax-free growth on contributions up to $69,000

## Common Side Hustle Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Starting Multiple Hustles at Once**
- Focus on one until it hits $500+/month
- Master one business model before diversifying

**2. Underpricing Your Work**
- Research market rates in your area
- Raise rates every 6-12 months
- Higher rates = fewer clients + more profit

**3. Not Tracking Time & Income**
- You won't know if you're earning minimum wage or $100/hour
- Use time-tracking apps (Toggl, Harvest)
- Spreadsheet minimum for income tracking

**4. Exhaustion from Overcommitment**
- Don't work so much you burn out
- Side hustles should add to life, not drain it
- Maximum 12-15 hours/week side + full-time job

**5. Ignoring Taxes**
- Set aside 25-30% of side income for taxes
- Track deductible expenses
- Quarterly estimated tax payments if earning $1,000+

## Conclusion

A side hustle is one of the fastest ways to accelerate financial goals. Whether you want $100/month passive income or $2,000+/month active work, opportunities exist for every skill level and time commitment.

**Action Plan:**
1. Identify your most valuable asset (time, skills, capital)

3. Set a specific income goal ($300/month, $1,000/month, etc.)
4. Commit to 3 months of focused effort
5. Track income and adjust strategy based on results
6. Scale what works, abandon what doesn't
