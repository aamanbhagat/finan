## Introduction

Real estate is one of the most proven paths to generational wealth. Unlike stocks which can be volatile, real estate provides tangible assets, leverage opportunities, monthly income, and tax benefits. This guide covers rental property investment, home equity building, and different real estate strategies for accelerating wealth.

## Why Real Estate Builds Wealth

### The Leverage Advantage

Real estate is unique—you can borrow 80% of purchase price.

**Example: Real Estate vs. Stocks**

**Stock Investment ($100,000):**
- Buy $100,000 in index funds
- 6% annual return = $6,000/year
- Need $100,000 cash upfront

**Real Estate Investment ($100,000 down payment):**
- Buy $500,000 rental property (80% financed)
- 6% appreciation = $30,000/year property appreciation
- Plus $400/month rental income = $4,800/year
- Total return: $34,800/year on $100,000 investment = 34.8% ROI
- Used 5:1 leverage to multiply returns

**20-year comparison:**
- Stocks: ~$500,000 (from $100k at 6% return)
- Real Estate: ~$1,200,000+ (from $100k leveraged 5:1)

### Tax Benefits of Real Estate

Real estate offers unique tax advantages:

| Benefit | How it Works | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Mortgage interest deduction | Reduce taxable income | $10,000 interest deductible |
| Property tax deduction | Full deduction on taxes | $4,000 property tax deductible |
| Depreciation | 27.5 years depreciation on building | $500k building ÷ 27.5 = $18,182/year deduction |
| Maintenance expenses | All repairs, improvements deductible | Paint, roof, plumbing deductible |
| Capital gains exclusion | $250k/$500k tax-free home sale gain | Sell $600k home, buy $500k = $100k taxable (some exceptions) |
| 1031 Exchange | Defer all capital gains by exchanging | Sell property, buy equal or greater value, no taxes |

**Depreciation example:**
- Property value: $500,000
- Depreciation deduction: $18,182/year
- Tax savings: $4,364/year (24% bracket)
- Over 27.5 years: $120,000+ in tax savings

## Real Estate Investment Strategies

### Strategy 1: Long-Term Rental Properties

Buy property, rent to tenants, build wealth over 20-30 years.

**The Model:**
1. Buy property below market value
2. Rent for income and appreciation
3. Use rental income to pay down mortgage
4. After 20-30 years, own property outright
5. Rental income becomes nearly all profit

**Requirements:**
- Down payment: 20-25% ($100,000 for $500,000 property)
- Credit score: 620+ (better: 680+)
- Income: 2-3x annual property expenses
- Time: 10-15 hours/month management

**Financial Snapshot ($500k rental):**

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Purchase price | $500,000 |
| Down payment (20%) | $100,000 |
| Loan amount | $400,000 |
| Mortgage (30-year, 6%) | $2,399/month |
| Property taxes | $400/month |
| Insurance | $150/month |
| Maintenance (5-10% revenue) | $200/month |
| **Total expenses** | **$3,149/month** |
| Monthly rent | $3,500 |
| **Cash flow** | **$351/month** |

**20-Year Results:**
- Cash flow after expenses: $351/month = $4,212/year
- Total cash flow 20 years: $84,240
- Property appreciation (3%/year): $265,000
- Mortgage paid down: $200,000
- Taxes paid from rent: ~$15,000
- **Total wealth created: $465,000+**
- Return on $100,000 down: 465%

**Why it works:**
- Mortgage paid by tenant (forced savings)
- Appreciation is "free"
- Tax deductions reduce taxable income
- Inflation helps (nominal rent rises, fixed mortgage payment)

### Strategy 2: House Hacking

Live in one unit, rent out others (primary residence with rental income).

**Example: Duplex house hack**
- Buy duplex for $400,000
- Live in one unit (primary residence)
- Rent other unit for $2,000/month
- $2,000 rental income covers most/all mortgage

**Advantages:**
- Lower down payment (can use 3-5% FHA loan as primary)
- Live free or cheap while building equity
- Perfect entry point to real estate
- Primary residence benefits + rental income

**Example timeline:**
- Age 25: Buy duplex, live in one side, rent other
- Rent covers 80% of mortgage
- Age 27: Move out, rent both sides
- At 45: Fully paid off, collect $4,000+/month
- Age 65: Retiring on property income

### Strategy 3: Fix and Flip

Buy undervalued property, renovate, sell for profit.

**The Model:**
1. Find distressed property below market
2. Buy at discount (below-market cash price)
3. Renovate/upgrade
4. Sell at full market price
5. Profit = Sale price - Purchase - Renovations

**Requirements:**
- Capital: $50,000-$200,000 cash (or line of credit)
- Knowledge: Construction, contractors, estimates
- Time: 3-6 months active involvement per property
- Network: Contractors, real estate agents, cash lenders

**Typical Flip Numbers:**

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Purchase price (60% of ARV) | $200,000 |
| Renovation budget | $50,000 |
| Carrying costs (6 months) | $8,000 |
| **Total investment** | **$258,000** |
| After repair value (ARV) | $350,000 |
| Sale at 90% ARV | $315,000 |
| Closing costs (6%) | -$18,900 |
| **Net sale proceeds** | **$296,100** |
| **Profit** | **$38,100** |
| **Return on investment** | **14.8%** |

**Timeline to profit:** 3-6 months (vs. 20 years for rentals)

**Risks:**
- Market changes during project
- Renovation cost overruns common
- Tenant issues if occupied
- Market dependent (sell when market hot)

### Strategy 4: REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust)

Stock market approach to real estate—own real estate without directly managing properties.

**What is a REIT:**
- Company that owns/operates real estate portfolio
- Must distribute 90% of income as dividends
- Trades on stock market like regular stock
- Highly liquid (sell anytime)

**Popular REITs:**

| REIT | Dividend Yield | Focus | Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| Realty Income (O) | 3.8% | Retail, office | $52 |
| Prologis (PLD) | 2.1% | Warehouses | $91 |
| Welltower (WELL) | 4.2% | Healthcare | $65 |
| Equinix (EQIX) | 1.8% | Data centers | $196 |
| Federal Realty (FRT) | 3.3% | Retail centers | $80 |

**Example REIT investing:**
- Invest $10,000 in Realty Income (O)
- Receive 3.8% annual dividend = $380/year
- Stock price growth (typically 5-8%/year)
- Total return: 8-11%+ annually
- Zero management required

**REIT vs. Physical Property:**

| Factor | Physical Property | REIT |
|---|---|---|
| Capital required | $100,000+ | $500-$10,000 |
| Leverage | 80% available | None |
| Management | 10-20 hours/month | Zero |
| Taxes | Complex, many deductions | Simpler, dividends taxed |
| Liquidity | 3-6 months to sell | Immediate (stock market) |
| Diversification | Single property | 100+ properties typically |

**Best for:** Passive real estate income without management

## Building Wealth Through Home Equity

### Your Primary Residence

Your home builds wealth three ways:

**1. Forced Savings (Mortgage Paydown)**
- 30-year mortgage forces $2,000/month savings
- Without discipline, people spend $2,000/month instead
- After 30 years: Home is free (vs. renting = $0 equity)

**2. Appreciation**
- Historical: 3-4% annual appreciation
- $300,000 home: $12,000/year gain
- 20 years: $300,000 in appreciation gain

**3. Leverage**
- Borrow $300,000, live in asset
- Appreciation on $300,000 with $60,000 down
- 6% appreciation = $18,000/year on $60,000 investment = 30% return

**30-Year Home Ownership Timeline:**

| Year | Mortgage Balance | Equity | Home Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | $300,000 | $60,000 | $360,000 |
| 5 | $265,000 | $95,000 | $418,000 |
| 10 | $220,000 | $140,000 | $485,000 |
| 15 | $160,000 | $200,000 | $560,000 |
| 20 | $80,000 | $280,000 | $645,000 |
| 30 | $0 | $620,000+ | $855,000+ |

**Equity growth sources:**
- Paydown: $300,000
- Appreciation: $330,000+
- **Total: $630,000+ wealth**

### Paying Off Your Mortgage Early

Paying mortgage in 15 years instead of 30:

| Item | 30-Year Mortgage | 15-Year Mortgage |
|---|---|---|
| Payment | $1,799/month | $2,413/month |
| Total interest paid | $347,000 | $125,000 |
| Interest saved | - | $222,000 |
| Payoff age | 65 | 50 |
| Years debt-free before retirement | 0 | 15 |

**Decision:** 15-year if you can afford payment, otherwise invest difference and take 30-year.

**Example comparison:**
- 30-year: $1,799 payment
- 15-year: $2,413 payment
- Difference: $614/month

**Alternative: Take 30-year, invest $614/month:**
- Investment returns: 6% annually
- 30 years of $614/month investing
- Final balance: $650,000
- Home also paid off (both strategies pay off in 30 years)
- 30-year lets you invest difference = potentially bigger wealth

## Real Estate Numbers Everyone Should Know

### Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)

Measures return on real estate investment.

**Formula:** Annual net income ÷ Property price

**Example:**
- Property price: $500,000
- Annual rental income: $42,000
- Annual expenses: $12,000
- Net income: $30,000
- Cap rate: $30,000 ÷ $500,000 = 6% cap rate

**What's good:**
- Under 4%: Low return, probably appreciating market
- 4-6%: Moderate return, balanced
- 6-10%: Good return, often in less desirable areas
- 10%+: High return, high risk

### Cash-on-Cash Return

Actual yearly return on money invested.

**Example:**
- Down payment: $100,000
- Annual cash flow after all expenses: $5,000
- Cash-on-cash return: $5,000 ÷ $100,000 = 5%

**Typical targets:** 5-10% cash-on-cash return

### The 1% Rule

Property should rent for at least 1% of purchase price monthly.

**Example:**
- Property costs: $300,000
- Monthly rent: $3,000+ (1% rule)
- If rent is $2,500 (less than 1%): Skip property
