## What is the Stock Market?

The stock market is a platform where shares of publicly-traded companies are bought and sold. It represents ownership stakes in businesses and serves as a crucial mechanism for companies to raise capital and for investors to build wealth.

### Key Definition
A **stock** (or share) is a unit of ownership in a company. When you buy a stock, you become a partial owner of that company and are entitled to a proportionate share of its profits.

## How the Stock Market Works

### The Basic Flow

1. **Company Goes Public**: A company issues Initial Public Offering (IPO) shares to raise capital
2. **Listing**: Shares are listed on stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, etc.)
3. **Trading**: Buyers and sellers trade shares through brokers
4. **Price Determination**: Supply and demand determine stock prices
5. **Ownership**: Shareholders own percentage of company

### Stock Exchanges

Major stock exchanges where trading occurs:

| Exchange | Location | Founded | Notable Companies |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **NYSE** | New York, USA | 1792 | Apple, Microsoft, JPMorgan |
| **NASDAQ** | New York, USA | 1971 | Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta |
| **LSE** | London, UK | 1801 | HSBC, Shell, Unilever |
| **TSE** | Tokyo, Japan | 1878 | Toyota, Sony, Honda |
| **SSE** | Shanghai, China | 1990 | ICBC, PetroChina, Alibaba |

## Types of Stocks

### 1. Common Stocks
- Represent ownership with voting rights
- Eligible for dividends (when company distributes profits)
- Last claim on assets in bankruptcy
- Typical for individual investors

### 2. Preferred Stocks
- Higher priority for dividends and assets
- Fixed dividend payments
- Generally no voting rights
- Lower price volatility
- Suitable for income-focused investors

### 3. Blue-Chip Stocks
- Shares of large, established companies
- Strong financial performance history

- Examples: Apple, Microsoft, Coca-Cola

### 4. Growth Stocks
- Focus on revenue and earnings expansion

- Limited or no dividends
- Higher volatility and risk
- Examples: Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon

### 5. Value Stocks
- Trading below intrinsic value
- Often mature, established companies
- Focus on stable returns
- Lower growth prospects
- Examples: Ford, Bank of America

### 6. Penny Stocks
- Low-priced stocks (< $5)
- High risk and volatility
- Limited liquidity
- Speculation-driven
- **Caution advised**: High probability of losses

## Understanding Stock Prices

### What Determines Stock Price?

**Supply and Demand**:
- More buyers than sellers → price increases
- More sellers than buyers → price decreases
- Fundamental shifts drive long-term trends

**Company Fundamentals**:
- Earnings growth
- Revenue trends
- Profitability
- Market position
- Industry conditions

**Market Sentiment**:
- Economic outlook
- Interest rates
- Geopolitical events
- Investor confidence

**Technical Factors**:
- Historical price patterns
- Trading volume
- Support and resistance levels
- Momentum indicators

### Stock Price vs. Company Value

Many beginners confuse a low stock price with a good deal. **Price ≠ Value**

Example:
- **Stock A**: $10/share × 1 billion shares = $10B market cap
- **Stock B**: $100/share × 100 million shares = $10B market cap

Both companies have identical value despite different prices. Stock price alone doesn't indicate quality.

## Key Stock Market Metrics

### Market Capitalization (Market Cap)
Market cap = Stock Price × Total Shares Outstanding

Companies classified by size:
- **Large-Cap**: > $10 billion (stable, mature)
- **Mid-Cap**: $2-10 billion (balanced growth/stability)
- **Small-Cap**: $300M-2 billion (higher growth potential)
- **Micro-Cap**: < $300 million (very high risk)

### Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)
P/E = Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share

Interpretation:
- **Low P/E** (< 15): May be undervalued or facing challenges
- **Average P/E** (15-25): In line with market average
- **High P/E** (> 25): Market expects strong growth or premium brand

### Earnings Per Share (EPS)
EPS = Company Net Income ÷ Total Shares Outstanding

- Higher EPS indicates better profitability
- Compare EPS trends over time
- EPS growth drives long-term stock appreciation

### Dividend Yield
Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend ÷ Stock Price

- 2-3% typical for blue-chip stocks
- > 4% may indicate value opportunity or trouble
- Growing dividends indicate company health

### Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B)
P/B = Stock Price ÷ Book Value Per Share

- P/B < 1.0 may indicate undervaluation
- Useful for asset-heavy industries
- Technology companies often have high P/B

### Step 5: Monitor and Manage

## Common Stock Market Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Emotional Trading
**Problem**: Buying high during euphoria, selling low during panic
**Solution**: Create investment plan, stick to it, avoid watching prices constantly

### 2. Lack of Diversification
**Problem**: Concentrating in few stocks increases risk
**Solution**: Own 15-30 stocks or use diversified index funds

### 3. Overtrading

## The Power of Long-Term Investing
