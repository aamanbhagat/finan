## Why Insurance Matters

### Risk Categories

## Types of Insurance

### 1. Life Insurance

**Purpose**: Replace income and pay final expenses when income earner dies

**Two Main Types**:

**Term Life Insurance**
- Coverage for specific period (10, 20, 30 years)
- Lowest cost option
- No cash value
- Renews at higher premium if extended
- Best for income replacement

**Pricing Example**: 30-year-old, $1M coverage
- Term (20 years): $30-50/month
- Whole life: $500-800/month

**Permanent Life Insurance (Whole Life)**
- Lifetime coverage
- Builds cash value
- Much more expensive
- Can borrow against cash value
- Limited flexibility

**Coverage Amount Calculation**:
- 10-15× annual income, OR
- Income replacement method (need monthly payment), OR
- Debt + final expenses + education funds

**Example**: 
- Annual income: $100,000
- 10× = $1,000,000 coverage
- Cost: ~$40-60/month (age 30, term-20)

### 2. Health Insurance

**Importance**: Medical costs can exceed $1M+ for serious illness

**Coverage Types**:

**Key Metrics**:

- **Deductible**: Amount paid before insurance covers (e.g., $1,500)
- **Copay**: Fixed cost per visit ($25-50)
