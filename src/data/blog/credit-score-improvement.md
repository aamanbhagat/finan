## Introduction

Your credit score determines whether you can borrow money and at what interest rate. A 50-point difference in credit score can cost you $10,000+ over a 30-year mortgage. This guide explains how credit scores work, what damages them, and proven strategies to build and maintain excellent credit. Whether you're starting from scratch or recovering from poor credit, this roadmap works.

## Understanding Credit Scores

### What is a Credit Score?

A credit score is a three-digit number (300-850) that represents your creditworthiness. Lenders use it to determine:
- Whether to approve your application
- What interest rate to charge you
- How much to lend you
- What credit terms to offer

### Why Your Score Matters

**Mortgage Approval & Rates:**

| Credit Score | Interest Rate | Monthly Payment ($300k) | 30-Year Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| 620 (poor) | 7.5% | $2,098 | $755,000 |
| 700 (fair) | 6.5% | $1,896 | $682,000 |
| 750 (good) | 6.0% | $1,799 | $647,000 |
| 800+ (excellent) | 5.5% | $1,703 | $613,000 |

**Impact:** 180-point difference costs $142,000 over 30 years on a single mortgage.

### Major Credit Score Factors

| Factor | Weight | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Payment history | 35% | Most important factor |
| Credit utilization | 30% | Debt-to-credit ratio |
| Length of credit | 15% | Age of accounts |
| Credit mix | 10% | Types of credit used |
| New credit inquiries | 10% | Recent applications |

## Building Credit From Zero

### If You Have No Credit History

**Challenge:** You can't build credit without credit (catch-22)

**Solutions:**

#### Secured Credit Card

Requires cash deposit, builds credit with responsible use.

| Card Type | Deposit | Credit Limit | APR | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Secured card | $200-$2,500 | Equal to deposit | 18-24% | Complete beginners |
| Unsecured card | None | $300-$1,000 | 18-24% | 6+ months credit history |
| Student card | None | $300-$500 | 20-25% | College students |
| Authorized user | None | Depends on main | Varies | Piggyback building |

**Secured Card Process:**
1. Open account with $500 deposit
2. Receive $500 credit limit
3. Use card for small purchases
4. Pay full balance monthly (no interest)
5. After 6-12 months, upgrade to unsecured card
6. Get deposit back

**Example Timeline:**
- Month 0: Open secured card, deposit $500
- Months 1-12: Use responsibly, pay full balance
- Month 12: Issuer upgrades to unsecured card
- Card provides: Payment history + established credit age

#### Becoming an Authorized User

Ask family/friend with good credit to add you to their account.

**Benefits:**
- Their account history helps your score
- No deposit required
- Immediate credit boost (typically +50-100 points)
- No responsibility for payments

**Caution:** Only works if primary user has excellent payment history. One missed payment hurts you too.

#### Credit Builder Loan

Special loan designed to build credit.

**How it works:**
1. Borrow $500-$1,000 from credit union
2. Money goes into savings account (you can't use it)
3. Make monthly payments on the loan
4. After 12 months: Get your money back + credit history

**Example:**
- Borrow $600 for 12 months
- Monthly payment: $50
- After 12 months: Get $600 back + established credit history
- Cost: $0 (you get your money back)
- Benefit: Established payment history

## Optimizing Credit Utilization

### The 30% Rule

Credit utilization (debt-to-credit ratio) impacts 30% of your score.

**Formula:** Total debt ÷ Total credit limit

### Credit Utilization Examples

| Scenario | Credit Limit | Balance | Utilization | Score Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Responsible | $10,000 | $2,000 | 20% | +100 points |
| Optimal | $10,000 | $3,000 | 30% | +50 points |
| Marginal | $10,000 | $5,000 | 50% | -30 points |
| High | $10,000 | $8,000 | 80% | -100 points |
| Maxed | $10,000 | $10,000 | 100% | -150 points |

**Key insight:** You don't need to pay interest to build credit. Pay balance in full monthly.

### Strategies to Lower Utilization

**Strategy 1: Increase Credit Limits**
- Call card issuer: "Can you increase my limit?"
- No hard inquiry needed
- Often approved for good payment history
- Instantly lowers utilization ratio

**Example:**
- Previous: $3,000 balance ÷ $5,000 limit = 60% utilization
- After increase: $3,000 balance ÷ $10,000 limit = 30% utilization
- Score improvement: +40-50 points

**Strategy 2: Pay Down Debt Strategically**
- Prioritize cards with highest utilization
- Pay multiple times per month (before statement closing)
- Goal: All cards below 30%

**Strategy 3: Keep Old Cards Open**
- Closing cards reduces total available credit
- Instantly raises utilization percentage
- Keep old cards open with $0 balance

**Example of Closing Impact:**
- Card 1: $1,000 balance, $5,000 limit
- Card 2: $0 balance, $5,000 limit
- Total utilization: $1,000 ÷ $10,000 = 10%

Now close Card 2:
- Total utilization: $1,000 ÷ $5,000 = 20%
- Score drops 10-20 points from one action

## Payment History Excellence

### Payment History is 35% of Score

Late payments are the most damaging factor.

| Late Payment | Score Impact | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| 30 days late | -100 points | 7 years |
| 60 days late | -150 points | 7 years |
| 90 days late | -200 points | 7 years |
| Collections | -300+ points | 7 years |

**Impact lasts 7 years.** A 30-day late payment today affects your score until 2032.

### Preventing Late Payments

**Strategy 1: Automatic Payments**
- Enroll in auto-pay from checking account
- Set for amount: Minimum, statement balance, or fixed
- Prevents forgetfulness
- Requires sufficient funds in account

**Strategy 2: Calendar Reminders**
- Set phone/email reminders 5 days before due date
- Check account 3 days before to ensure payment processed
- Backup if auto-pay fails

**Strategy 3: Strategic Due Dates**
- Align all payments to same day (easier tracking)
- Contact creditors to change due dates
- Example: All cards due on 15th (payday)

**Strategy 4: Payment Apps**
- Use payment apps with bill management features
- Sends reminders automatically
- Tracks due dates across multiple creditors

### If You Have Past Late Payments

**Recovery Timeline:**

| Months Since Late | Typical Score Improvement |
|---|---|
| 1-6 months | Minimal (impact still fresh) |
| 6-12 months | +20-40 points |
| 1-2 years | +40-80 points |
| 2-3 years | +60-100 points |
| 3+ years | +80-150 points |
| 7 years | Falls off report (major jump) |

**Positive action:** Even with past mistakes, consistent on-time payments rebuild credit steadily.

## Length of Credit History

### Why Long History Matters

Lenders trust proven reliability over time.

| Account Age | Score Impact |
|---|---|
| New (0-6 months) | Minimal history |
| 1-2 years | Establishing pattern |
| 3-5 years | Solid history |
| 5-10 years | Strong credit |
| 10+ years | Excellent credit foundation |

**Average account age calculation:**
Sum of all account ages ÷ Number of accounts

**Example:**
- Card 1: 10 years old
- Card 2: 3 years old
- Card 3: 1 year old
- Average: (10 + 3 + 1) ÷ 3 = 4.7 years

### Maintaining Credit History Length

**Never close old cards** (even with $0 balance)

**Example damage from closing:**
- Average age: 4.7 years (three accounts)
- Close 10-year card
- New average: (3 + 1) ÷ 2 = 2 years
- Score impact: -30-50 points from shorter history

**Better strategy:** Keep old card open with small monthly charge (Netflix, etc.), pay automatically.

## Credit Mix (Diversification)

### Types of Credit

Credit mix (10% of score) rewards using different credit types.

| Credit Type | Example | Account Age Needed |
|---|---|---|
| Revolving | Credit cards, HELOCs | 3-6 months |
| Installment | Auto loan, personal loan | 3-6 months |
| Mortgage | Home loan | Any time |
| Retail | Store credit cards | Any time |

**Healthy mix example:**
- 2-3 credit cards (revolving)
- 1 auto loan (installment)
- 1 mortgage (installment)
- Results in +20-30 point boost from diversification

**Don't force it:** Only take credit you actually need. One type well-managed beats multiple types with high utilization.

## Repairing Damaged Credit

### If You Have Delinquencies

**Recovery sequence:**

**Step 1: Stop the bleeding**
- Immediately pay all current bills on time
- Start perfect payment history now

**Step 2: Address past delinquencies**
- Pay old debts (payment shows good intent)
- Negotiate settlements if applicable
- Prioritize recent vs. old

**Step 3: Dispute inaccuracies**
- Check credit report at annualcreditreport.com (free)
- Look for errors, duplicates, unauthorized accounts
- Dispute inaccuracies by mail/online
- Errors often removed within 30 days

**Step 4: Wait for aging**
- Delinquencies damage decreases yearly
- After 3 years: ~50% of impact
- After 5 years: ~80% of impact
- After 7 years: Falls off report completely

### Collections Account Recovery

If in collections (debt sold to collection agency):

**Best outcome:** Pay collector for removal

**Negotiation script:**
"My account shows a collections balance of $2,500. I'm ready to pay, but want it removed from my credit report. Will you delete the account if I pay in full today?"

**Likely responses:**
- 30% agree to deletion
- 50% agree to payment with notation "paid collections"
- 20% refuse negotiation

**Next best:** "Paid collections" still hurts less than "unpaid collections"
