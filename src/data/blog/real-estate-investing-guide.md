## How to Get Started with Real Estate

### Step 1: Assess Your Financial Position
- Review credit score (aim for 620+)
- Save for down payment (15-25%)
- Get pre-approved for mortgage
- Build emergency fund (6-12 months)

### Step 2: Define Your Investment Strategy
- Decide between rental or fix-and-flip
- Choose property type (residential, commercial)
- Set target cap rate or cash-on-cash return
- Determine geographic market preference

### Step 3: Research Markets
- **Population Growth** - Growing areas attract tenants
- **Job Market** - Strong employment supports property values
- **Rental Rates** - Analyze local rent trends
- **Vacancy Rates** - Lower vacancy = better returns
- **Property Appreciation** - Historical price trends

### Step 4: Find Properties
- Use MLS listings
- Real estate websites (Zillow, Realtor.com)
- Direct mail to property owners
- Real estate agents
- Wholesalers and off-market deals

### Step 5: Analyze Properties
- Calculate cap rate
- Estimate repair costs (for fix-and-flip)
- Project rental income
- Account for vacancies and expenses
- Use spreadsheets or analysis software

## Key Real Estate Metrics

### Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate)
**Formula**: Net Operating Income ÷ Property Price

Example: $100,000 annual income ÷ $1,000,000 property = 10% cap rate

**Target**: 6-12% depending on market and property type

### Cash-on-Cash Return
**Formula**: Annual Cash Flow ÷ Cash Invested

Example: $6,000 annual cash flow ÷ $50,000 down payment = 12% cash-on-cash

### Price-to-Rent Ratio
**Formula**: Property Price ÷ Annual Rental Income

Example: $200,000 property ÷ $12,000 annual rent = 16.7 ratio

**Interpretation**: Lower ratios (16:1 or less) suggest better rental returns

## Financing Real Estate

### Conventional Mortgages
- 15-30 year terms
- Fixed or adjustable rates
- Typical rates: 5-7%
- Down payment: 15-25%

### FHA Loans
- Lower down payment (3.5%)
- Easier qualification
- Mortgage insurance required
- Owner-occupied only

### HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit)
- Borrow against existing equity
- Lower rates than mortgages
- Flexible draws
- Good for multiple properties

### Cash Purchases
- No mortgage payments
- Lower returns due to leverage
- Faster closing
- Good for partnerships

## Managing Rental Properties
