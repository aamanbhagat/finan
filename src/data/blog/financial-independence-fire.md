## Introduction

Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) is a movement focused on achieving financial independence through aggressive saving and smart investing, allowing retirement decades before traditional retirement age. Instead of working 40+ years until age 65, FIRE adherents aim to build enough wealth by 40-50 to stop working. This guide explains the math, strategies, and lifestyle changes needed to achieve financial independence.

## The Core FIRE Math

### The 4% Rule

The foundational concept of FIRE: The 4% rule states you can safely withdraw 4% of your portfolio annually without running out of money over 30+ years.

**Formula:**
Annual spending × 25 = FIRE number needed

**Example:**
- Annual spending: $50,000
- FIRE number: $50,000 × 25 = $1,250,000
- Withdraw 4% annually: $1,250,000 × 0.04 = $50,000/year
- With 7% returns, $50,000 withdrawal sustainable indefinitely

**Why it works:**
- Portfolio grows at ~7% historically
- Withdraw 4%
- Portfolio still grows at 3% (7% - 4% = 3%)
- Inflation protected: Raise withdrawal with inflation
- 95%+ success rate over 30+ years (historical data)

### Different Spending Scenarios

| Annual Spending | FIRE Number | Years to FI |
|---|---|---|
| $30,000 (minimal) | $750,000 | 8-10 years |
| $40,000 (modest) | $1,000,000 | 12-15 years |
| $50,000 (moderate) | $1,250,000 | 15-20 years |
| $60,000 (comfortable) | $1,500,000 | 18-22 years |
| $75,000 (affluent) | $1,875,000 | 22-27 years |
| $100,000 (wealthy) | $2,500,000 | 27-32 years |

**Key insight:** Doubling spending means doubling money needed. Halving spending cuts timeline significantly.

### The Savings Rate Impact

Time to financial independence is determined by savings rate (% of income saved).

| Savings Rate | Years to FI |
|---|---|
| 25% | 32 years |
| 40% | 21.9 years |
| 50% | 16.6 years |
| 60% | 12.9 years |
| 70% | 10 years |
| 80% | 7.5 years |
| 90% | 4.2 years |

**Key insight:** Increasing savings rate from 20% to 50% cuts timeline from 37 years to 16.6 years (20+ year difference).

### Savings Rate Formula

Savings rate = (Savings ÷ Income) × 100

**Example:**
- Income: $80,000/year
- Expenses: $40,000/year
- Savings: $40,000/year
- Savings rate: $40,000 ÷ $80,000 = 50%

**Higher savings rate strategies:**
- Increase income (side hustle, job change)
- Decrease expenses (cheaper housing, reduce consumption)
- Both together (most powerful)

## FIRE Calculation Examples

### Scenario 1: Moderate FIRE (Work ~20 years)

**Income:** $70,000/year
**Expenses:** $35,000/year (minimize lifestyle)
**Savings rate:** 50% = $35,000/year

| Year | Annual Savings | Total Saved | Growth (6%) | Total Portfolio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $35,000 | $35,000 | $2,100 | $37,100 |
| 5 | $35,000 | $175,000 | $20,000 | $225,000 |
| 10 | $35,000 | $350,000 | $60,000 | $475,000 |
| 15 | $35,000 | $525,000 | $110,000 | $875,000 |
| 20 | $35,000 | $700,000 | $165,000 | $1,400,000 |

**At year 20:**
- Portfolio: $1,400,000
- 4% withdrawal: $56,000/year
- Exceeds spending needs of $35,000
- **Can retire at age 42-45**

### Scenario 2: Aggressive FIRE (Work ~10 years)

**Income:** $120,000/year
**Expenses:** $30,000/year (minimal lifestyle)
**Savings rate:** 75% = $90,000/year

| Year | Annual Savings | Total Saved | Growth (6%) | Total Portfolio |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | $90,000 | $450,000 | $45,000 | $540,000 |
| 10 | $90,000 | $900,000 | $130,000 | $1,150,000 |

**At year 10:**
- Portfolio: $1,150,000
- 4% withdrawal: $46,000/year
- Exceeds spending needs of $30,000
- **Can retire at age 32-35**

### Scenario 3: Traditional Path (Work 40+ years)

**Income:** $60,000/year
**Expenses:** $48,000/year (high consumption)
**Savings rate:** 20% = $12,000/year

**At year 40:**
- Portfolio: $1,200,000
- 4% withdrawal: $48,000/year
- Matches spending needs
- **Can retire at age 65**

**Comparison:**
- Scenario 1: Retire at 45 with $1,400,000
- Scenario 2: Retire at 35 with $1,150,000
- Scenario 3: Retire at 65 with $1,200,000

20-30 years of freedom difference from lifestyle choices.

## FIRE Lifestyle & Strategies

### Minimalism & Expense Reduction

Core FIRE principle: Reduce expenses to maximize savings.

**Typical Expense Categories:**

| Category | Traditional | FIRE |
|---|---|---|
| Housing | $1,500/month | $500-800/month |
| Food | $800/month | $300-400/month |
| Transportation | $600/month | $0-200/month |
| Entertainment | $400/month | $50-100/month |
| Utilities | $150/month | $100-150/month |
| Misc | $300/month | $50/month |
| **Total** | **$3,750/month** | **$1,050-1,800/month** |

**Housing strategies (biggest expense):**
- Live with family (free/cheap)
- House hack (rent covers mortgage)
- Move to low cost-of-living area
- Small home (cheaper to buy, heat, cool)

**Food strategies:**
- Cook at home (vs. eating out: 50% savings)
- Buy generic brands (30% savings)
- Buy in bulk (20% savings)
- Reduce meat consumption (30% savings on food)

**Transportation strategies:**
- No car (public transit, cycling)
- One car household (30% savings)
- Used reliable car (Toyota, Honda) 
- Drive maintenance-focused (extend life 10+ years)

### Geographic Arbitrage

Live in low cost-of-living area (or country).

**Cost of Living Comparison (Monthly):**

| Location | Housing | Food | Transport | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| San Francisco | $2,500 | $600 | $150 | $3,250 |
| Chicago | $1,200 | $400 | $100 | $1,700 |
| Austin | $1,100 | $350 | $100 | $1,550 |
| Southeast (rural) | $700 | $300 | $100 | $1,100 |
| Overseas (Mexico, Portugal) | $600 | $200 | $50 | $850 |

**Impact on FIRE timeline:**
- $3,250/month spending → Need $975,000 portfolio
- $1,100/month spending → Need $330,000 portfolio
- Difference: Nearly $650,000 less needed
- Time savings: 5-7 years to FIRE

### Income Strategies

Increasing income reduces time to FIRE as much as cutting expenses.

**Income growth options:**
- Career advancement (raises, promotions)
- Job change (10-20% increase typical)
- Side hustle ($500-$2,000/month)
- Business creation ($0-$10,000+/month)
- Passive income (dividends, rental income)

**Example: $500/month side hustle impact**
- Extra income: $500/month = $6,000/year
- At 50% savings rate: $3,000/year additional savings
- Over 10 years: $30,000+ additional invested
- With growth: $40,000+ additional wealth
- Could cut timeline by 6-12 months

## FIRE Variants

### Lean FIRE

Minimize to $25,000-$40,000/year spending.

**Pros:**
- Achievable in 10-15 years
- Extreme freedom
- Location flexibility
- Sustainable (lower spending = lower withdrawal needs)

**Cons:**
- Very low spending lifestyle
- Healthcare on your own (not employer-provided)
- Vulnerable to market downturns
- May struggle mentally with minimal lifestyle

**Best for:** Minimalists, digital nomads, strong-willed people

### Fat FIRE

Target $100,000+/year spending.

**Pros:**

- Psychological comfort factor

**Cons:**
- Takes 30+ years to achieve
- Requires $2.5M+ portfolio
- Higher ongoing expenses
- Less differentiation from traditional retirement

**Best for:** Those wanting comfort, established high-earners

### Coast FIRE

Save aggressively for 10-15 years, then coast (no saving, no working).

**Example:**
- Age 30: Stop contributing to investments
- $500,000 saved
- Let compound at 6% for 30 years
- Age 60: $2,870,000 without additional contributions
- Retire at 60 with comfortable lifestyle

**Pros:**
- Work less-demanding job after initial sprint

## Safe Withdrawal Rates

### 4% Rule Revisited

The 4% rule is conservative and safe:

**Success rate:** 95% over 30 years (historical data)
**Means:** You have 95% confidence not running out of money

**Variations:**
- 3% rule: Nearly 100% success, more conservative
- 3.5% rule: 98% success, slightly conservative
- 4% rule: 95% success, standard recommendation
- 4.5% rule: 90% success, riskier

### Dynamic Withdrawal Strategy

Adjust withdrawals based on market performance:

**Good market year (+15%+):** Withdraw 4.5-5%
**Average year (+7%):** Withdraw 4%
**Poor year (-10%):** Withdraw 3-3.5%

**Result:** Reduces portfolio depletion risk while maintaining flexibility

### Healthcare Costs

Plan for healthcare in early retirement (before Medicare at 65):

**Options:**
1. **ACA insurance:** $200-$600/month depending on income
2. **Spouse's employer plan:** Continue after leaving job
3. **Health sharing ministries:** $100-$250/month
4. **Remote work:** Keep employer health insurance while retired
5. **Relocation:** Countries with cheap healthcare (Mexico, Portugal, Thailand)

**Budget:** Add $300-$500/month to expenses for healthcare
